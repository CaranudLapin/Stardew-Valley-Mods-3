Adventures In The Mines is my (Shockah's) submission to the very first Stardew Valley Mod Jam.

The theme of the mod jam was Iron Chef:
Similar to Iron Chef, you will find a list of featured ingredients. You must include at least three of the five ingredients in your mod.
How you interpret the ingredients is up to you, but you will be judged on how well your mod incorporates them so make sure there is no mistaking it.

Featured Ingredients:
* Slippery
* Boom
* Voyage
* Rotten
* Constellation

====================

The mod adds additional content to the mines (normal + dangerous Mine in Pelican Town, normal + dangerous Skull Caverns).
Due to limited time, the added content is limited to additional treasure chests, each one locked behind a kind of a puzzle.
Each floor has about a 1/5 of a chance to get such a treasure chest.

The mod incorporates the following ingredients:
* Slippery - Ice Skating puzzles
* Boom - Explosive, disarmable chests
* Rotten - The disarmable chests may also "rot" some of the food (remove it from the inventory)
* Constellation - Also meaning "a specific configuration/layout" - Combination/Sequence puzzles

The mod is nowhere near complete, it's unbalanced, it's currently untested in multiplayer, it lacks a lot of polish and it's definitely buggy. But I can definitely say it's a successful Minimum Viable Product!
I plan on polishing it out and adding new content in the future, and releasing it as a proper mod on Nexus Mods. I've already created an (unpublished) mod page and set the mod up to notify about a potential update.

Thanks for playing my mod, and I hope you'll like it!
