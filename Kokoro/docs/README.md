# Kokoro
A core mod for Shockah's mods.

There isn't much else to say. The common code between all of my mods kept causing all kinds of problems during development, so I decided to switch to a core mod. I tried to avoid it for as long as I could, no one likes getting dependencies manually, but I can't postpone it any longer.
