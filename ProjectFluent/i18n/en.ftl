        Technical details:
        By default (as of { -content-patcher-mod-name } version 1.24.x), { -content-patcher-mod-name } mods
        have to spell out the whole name of the Fluent localization token, including their ID.
        Enabling the "Patch all tokens" is discouraged, but if you are working on your own C# mod
        adding tokens for { -content-patcher-mod-name } mods, it will allow those to also be used directly.
